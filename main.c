/**************************
 *
 *	Lightweigh Java VM
 *
 *	Project is intended to provide a lightweight java virtual machine
 *	Can run both Java and C++ programs on seperate enviroments from underneath platform
 *	Your program will execute always the same way on every platform
 *	No JIT compilation and no different behaviour for different data
 *	Enterprise level of security, ECC checks and bulletprof isolation from outside world
 *	Perfect for Banking, Finance and Enterprises
 * 	100% compatible with your current java code, but executes it faster and more safetly than JVM
 *
 *	Main features are:
 *		- register based, with stack
 *		- application isolation, run every app in seperate enviroment
 *		- no batch memory allocation from kernel
 *		- dynamic memory allocation outside machine
 *		- returning memory to kernel after object is destroyed
 *		- no garbage colletion
 *		- destroy object and deallocate resources after pointer is released
 *		- all pointers are smart pointers
 *		- all refrences are counted to data object
 *		- no lazy initialization, all resources are initialized
 *			at the start of the system or dynamicly during runtime
 *		- no data duplication in memory, copy-on-write, one data, multiple pointers
 *		- 100% compatible with current java language spec, but executes instructions diffrently
 *		- continue running after program closed
 *		- prefetch resources, allocate before it's needed
 *		- predict resource allocation (no lazy allocation like normal java)
 *		- resolve dependencies and load them once, use multiple times
 *		- no cached interpreter of class files (better security)
 *
 *		- thread safty tests
 *		- memory leaks tests
 *		- compatibility tests
 * 		- performance tests, how much time it takes the execute certain algorithm on certain data
 *		- security tests
 *		-
 *
 * 		Security enhancments:
 *		- boundy checks
 *		- bit ecc checks on data types
 *		-
